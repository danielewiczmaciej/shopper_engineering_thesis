  abstract  = {The abundant volume of natural language text in the connected world, though having a large content of knowledge, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to disseminate it by a human to discover the knowledge/wisdom in it, specifically within any given time limits. The automated NLP is aimed to do this job effectively and with accuracy, like a human does it (for a limited of amount text). This chapter presents the challenges of NLP, progress so far made in this field, NLP applications, components of NLP, and grammar of English language---the way machine requires it. In addition, covers the specific areas like probabilistic parsing, ambiguities and their resolution, information extraction, discourse analysis, NL question-answering, commonsense interfaces, commonsense thinking and reasoning, causal-diversity, and various tools for NLP. Finally, the chapter summary, and a set of relevant exercises are presented.},
